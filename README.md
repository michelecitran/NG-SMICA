# NG-SMICA
I prepared this directory as a code sample for my application to the CMB group at the University of Oslo. 

It contains the multi-frequency multi-component binned bispectrum estimation explained in Citran et al. (arXiv:2511.22641).

The binned bispectrum is 

$$ B^{d_1d_2d_3}_{i_1i_2i_3}$$

where the index $d$ stands for the $d$-th frequency channel while the index $i$ represents the $i$-th bin.
